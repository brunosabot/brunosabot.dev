### Why Are We Using Tooltips

In our user interfaces, we often want to have to be a bit more specific about what icon buttons are for, but sometimes it could be hard to find the space to have a proper button with an icon and a text.

It is the case when we have a sharing bar with icons to share on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn alongs with copying the link and having a menu icon to handle additional actions.

To solve the label problem, we often use the following solution: add a tooltip that could be visible as the mouse gets over the button.

However, as an important User eXperience advice, **tooltips must be used sparingly**. You should always prioritize a button the label instead of them.

### What Are We Building?

The tooltip we are going to create is easy to use, 100% customizable, can be placed in every side of the targeted component and is just an overload, meaning you will not have to updatee your existing code.

The tooltip will look like this, but as I told you before, it can be replaced with your own very easily as long as it respects the component signature

### Requirements

The first thing to have a modal system is to have a modal root, where the system will take place. To do so, we just need to have a new `div#modal-root` element in our root document.

It is based on the very same fundations of my previous article: [Build an Easy Popup System With React](https://brunosabot.dev/posts/2021/build-an-easy-popup-system-with-react).

This base is important so the tooltip can be easily styled. With a separate root element, we are sure that the parent elements of the tooltip does not have styles that will make it harder for us to reach the perfect style.

To be sure that the tooltip will always be on top of the document, we just need to add the right `z-index` on the application root and the modal-root.

Also, since the tooltip behavior is to popin to the user as the link is overed, we add an [ARIA live region](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/ARIA_Live_Regions) to the tooltip system so it can be announced to the user.

The aria live region is set to assertive because we want the readers to have the same behavior as the browser, which places the popup on top of everything else.

### The tooltip components

The tooltip component is split into two different elements:

- A `ModalPortal` component that will link our modal to the `div#modal-root` element (the same as in [Build an Easy Popup System With React](https://brunosabot.dev/posts/2021/build-an-easy-popup-system-with-react))
- A `TooltipView` component that aims to handle the visible part of the tooltip
- A `withTooltip` high-order component that will handle the tooltip domain and that will be mounted to the target component

#### The ModalPortal component

The `ModalPortal` component exists to link our popup to the `div#modal-root` element that we have created. Hereâ€™s the code:

`gist:brunosabot/3110e062d9dc353ba3a47c28254ac6e1`

It is made of four sections:

- A `ref` corresponding to a simple `div` element, with the goal of holding the popup content. We do not use directly the root element so we are able to create two or more different popups if we want to stack them.
- A first `useEffect` hook to create the `div` element. This is a security to make the system work also on SSR systems such as NextJs or Gatsby.
- Another `useEffect` hook, to add the previously created `div` in the portal when active, and remove it when inactive. It will prevent the `div#modal-root` element to contain plenty of empty divs.
- The render part, which is null if neither the `div` element created does not exist or the popup is not currently active.

### The TooltipView component

The TooltipView component is pretty simple, and contain three props:

- `children`, which will be the tooltip content.
- `left`, which is the absolute left position where the tooltip will be placed
- `top`, which is the absolute top position where the tooltip will be placed
- `position`, which is an element of an enumeration of positions. It will be defaulted to the `TOP` value because it is the most common place for a tooltip.

As poiting arrow, I chose a svg element to have something less angular, but we can choose everything you want.

Note there are references to the withTooltip high order component we will discuss later. Every type used in the tooltip is externalized so we can use the proper signature in any other component we want to create.

This component is the one that you will be able to replace with your own. The component will be automatically placed in the page, however, you would probably give him a `max-width`, and the highest element in the tooltip -which is `.TooltipWrapper` in my case, should have a `position: absolute` CSS property.

Also, the positioning of the tooltip will need a little adjustment so it looks perfectly centered:

- For a top placed toolltip, we move left -50% to be perfectly centered, and top -100% so it will never overlap the content that activates the tooltip.
- For a right placed tooltip, we keep the same right position, but we move -50% top to get the perfect centering.
- For a bottom placed tooltip, we move left -50% to be perfectly centered, but keep the bottom value so the button will not overlap the content that activates the tooltip.
- For a left placed tootip, we move left -100% so our tooltip will not overlap the content, and to by -50% to get the perfect centering.

This is possibile because the `transform` property get the element as reference and not the parent element sizing like height and width did.

The rest is very specific of my tooltip implementation but let us get some time to understand what is done.

First of all, the `.TooltipWrapper` element has a maximum width of 350px, which will force the tooltip to get a new line if it is became too long. I also have added a 10px padding where I'm going to place the tooltip arrow.

The arrow will be placed and rotated based on the tooltip placement so it points to the content that activates the tooltip. You might want to remove this arrow in your case, since a lot of systems does not require it.

And that it! The tooltip is ready to get integrated in your system with the `withTooltip` high order component.
